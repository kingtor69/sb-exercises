  <h3>Part I: numbers</h3>
  <ol>
    <li id="I-1">Make a request to the Numbers API (<a href="http://numbersapi.com/">http://numbersapi.com/</a>) to get a fact about your favorite number. (Make sure you get back JSON by including the json query key, specific to this API. <a href="http://numbersapi.com/#json">Details</a>.</li>
    <li id="I-2">Figure out how to get data on multiple numbers in a single request. Make that request and when you get the data back, put all of the number facts on the page.</li>
    <li id="I-3">Use the API to get 4 facts on your favorite number. Once you have them all, put them on the page. It’s okay if some of the facts are repeats.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Part II: cards</h3>
  <ol>
    <li id="II-1">Make a request to the <a href="http://deckofcardsapi.com/">Deck of Cards API</a> to request a single card from a newly shuffled deck. Once you have the card, console.log the value and the suit (e.g. “5 of spades”, “queen of diamonds”).</li>
    <li id="II-2">Make a request to the deck of cards API to request a single card from a newly shuffled deck. Once you have the card, make a request to the same API to get one more card from the same deck. Once you have both cards, console.log the values and suits of both cards.</li>
    <li id="II-3">Build <a href="/cards.html">an HTML page</a> that lets you draw cards from a deck. When the page loads, go to the Deck of Cards API to create a new deck, and show a button on the page that will let you draw a card. Every time you click the button, display a new card, until there are no cards left in the deck.</li>
  </ol>
